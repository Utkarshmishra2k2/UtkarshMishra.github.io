                        The provided project begins with factor analysis to uncover underlying factors within the data, followed by preprocessing steps such as standardization and principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the number of components to retain. The script explores different factor rotation methods and interprets the factors based on their loadings. It then proceeds with logistic regression to predict a binary target variable and checks for multicollinearity. Finally, the script applies K Means clustering to identify patterns within the data. With extensive use of libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, factor_analyzer, and scikit-learn, the code provides a comprehensive analysis pipeline for understanding and modeling complex datasets.
